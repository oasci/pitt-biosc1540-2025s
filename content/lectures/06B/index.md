By the end of this lecture, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of transcriptomics' power in unraveling the intricacies of gene expression and its broad applications in biological research.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should have a better understanding of:

1.  Define transcriptomics and explain its role in understanding gene expression patterns.
2.  Discuss emerging trends in transcriptomics.
3.  Compare and contrast transcriptomics and genomics.
4.  Explain the principles of RNA-seq technology and its advantages over previous methods.
5.  Outline the computational pipeline for RNA-seq data analysis.

We'll explore the challenges of aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome and discuss various algorithms and data structures that make this process efficient.
The session will focus on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and the FM-index, two key concepts that revolutionized read alignment by enabling fast, memory-efficient sequence searching.
We'll examine how these techniques are implemented in popular alignment tools and compare their performance characteristics.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should have a better understanding of:

1.  Describe the challenges of aligning short reads to a large reference genome.
2.  Compare read alignment algorithms, including hash-based and suffix tree-based approaches.
3.  Explain the basic principles of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) for sequence alignment.
