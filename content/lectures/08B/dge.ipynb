    "- The blue points represent observed expression levels for SS316 samples.  \n",
    "- The orange points represent observed expression levels for LIS samples.  \n",

    "- The violin plot overlays the scatter plot and represents the distribution of 2,000 samples drawn from the fitted Negative Binomial distribution.  \n",

    "3. Differential Expression Testing with Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)  \n",
    "   - We used the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to compare a reduced model (single mean for all samples) to a full model (separate means for conditions).  \n",
    "   - DESeq2 performs a very similar LRT-based approach when testing for differential expression across multiple conditions, comparing nested models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log2 Fold Change (Log2FC) Interpretation  \n",
    "   - Both our approach and DESeq2 compute Log2 Fold Change (Log2FC) to quantify how much a gene's expression changes between conditions.  \n",
    "   - The Log2FC calculation follows the same equation:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\mu_1}\\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - DESeq2 applies shrinkage correction (via the \"apeglm\" or \"ashr\" methods) to prevent extremely large or unreliable Log2FC values, whereas our implementation does not currently include this correction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Our Approach Compared to DESeq2  \n",
    "\n",
    "While our Python-based implementation follows the core statistical principles behind DESeq2, there are several key limitations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dispersion Estimation is More Simplistic  \n",
    "   - In our approach, each gene has a single estimated $\\alpha$ (dispersion parameter).  \n",
    "   - DESeq2 shares information across genes to estimate dispersions more robustly, preventing overfitting and improving estimates for lowly expressed genes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. No Automatic Normalization  \n",
    "   - DESeq2 applies median ratio normalization (MRN), which corrects for differences in sequencing depth and RNA composition across samples.  \n",
    "   - Our implementation assumes that raw counts are comparable without explicitly normalizing them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shrinkage for Low Counts  \n",
    "   - DESeq2 applies Bayesian shrinkage to both dispersion estimates and Log2FC values, stabilizing results for low-expression genes.  \n",
    "   - Our implementation does not incorporate shrinkage, which may lead to more extreme fold changes for genes with low counts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiple Testing Correction  \n",
    "   - When testing thousands of genes, we must control for false discoveries.  \n",
    "   - DESeq2 automatically adjusts p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) correction, whereas our approach currently outputs raw p-values without multiple testing correction.  \n"

    "Now that we have gone through the process of identifying differentially expressed genes using the Negative Binomial model, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT), and Log2 Fold Change (Log2FC), it’s time to apply these methods to a different gene.

    "   - Compute the negative log-likelihood ($\\text{NLL}_f$).  \n",
