This foundational lecture highlights how atomistic-level details provide deeper biological insights.
Students will learn the role of thermodynamics, including enthalpic and entropic contributions, in molecular interactions.
The lecture emphasizes noncovalent interactions and introduces the significance of molecular flexibility and dynamics as crucial to understanding biological systems.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should better understand:

1.  Importance of atomistic-level insights in biology.
2.  Role of enthalpy and entropy in molecular interactions.
3.  Noncovalent interactions influencing biological functions.
4.  Importance of molecular flexibility and dynamics in biological activity.

Why Atomistic Detail Matters

    Connection between structure, dynamics, and function.

Thermodynamics in Biology

    Conceptual overview of enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS).
    Relation to molecular binding.

Noncovalent Interactions

    Types and biological significance.
    Examples in protein-ligand interactions.

Introduction to Molecular Dynamics

    Dynamics as essential to the full biological picture.
    Brief conceptual overview: "We can study atomic motions using MD simulations (covered later in the semester)."

Metrics of Flexibility and Dynamics

    Brief introduction to RMSD and RMSF (conceptual, not computational).
