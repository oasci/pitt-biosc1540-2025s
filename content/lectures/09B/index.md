This methodology lecture introduces students to computational tools and databases essential for structural biology.
Practical training involves accessing and analyzing protein structures from databases such as UniProt and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), along with an introduction to visualization tools like PyMOL for structural exploration and atomic model interpretation.

## Learning objectives

After today, you should have a better understanding of:

1.  How to locate and interpret protein structure data from UniProt and PDB.
2.  Basic functionalities of PyMOL software for visualization.
3.  Interpreting electron density maps and atomic models.
