This lecture introduces the field of computational structural biology and its interplay with experimental methods.
We'll explore how computational approaches complement and enhance traditional structural biology techniques, providing insights into protein structure, function, and dynamics.
The session will cover key experimental methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Categorize atomic interactions and their importance.
2.  Explain what is structural biology and why is it important.
3.  Communicate the basics of X-ray crystallization.
4.  Find and analyze protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
5.  Compare and contrast Cryo-EM to X-ray crystallization.
6.  Understand the experimental challenges of disorder.
7.  Know why protein structure prediction is helpful.
