# Protein Data Bank (PDB)

The **Protein Data Bank (PDB)** is a repository of experimentally determined macromolecular structures obtained through:

- **X-ray crystallography** – Provides high-resolution atomic details but may miss flexible regions.
- **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)** – Suitable for small proteins, includes multiple conformers.
- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)** – Captures large molecular complexes but at lower resolution.
