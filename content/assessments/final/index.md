During the final exam session, students will have the opportunity to retake any previously administered quizzes to improve their quiz average.
Each makeup quiz will replicate the original in both content and format, maintaining the integrity and expectations of the initial assessments.

Students are free to selectively retake any number of quizzes within the allotted exam period, focusing on those where improvement is most beneficial.
In keeping with a mastery-based learning model, only improved scores will be counted—if a retake score exceeds the original, it replaces it; if the retake is lower, the original score stands.
This no-risk format is designed to encourage thoughtful engagement and reduce test-related anxiety.

This strategy supports students who may have missed quizzes earlier in the semester, are approaching the 73% average threshold required for course benchmarks, or who are motivated to raise their letter grade through improved performance.

Beyond logistical flexibility, this approach embodies a pedagogical commitment to growth, reflection, and student agency.
By allowing targeted revision and reassessment, the makeup quiz opportunity promotes:

-   Formative assessment principles, where learning is seen as an ongoing process rather than a one-time event.
-   Self-directed learning, empowering students to identify their areas of weakness and take ownership of their improvement.
-   Reduced pressure, aligning assessment practices with research on motivation and performance under stress.
-   Equity and access, offering all students—regardless of circumstances earlier in the semester—a fair chance to demonstrate their understanding.
