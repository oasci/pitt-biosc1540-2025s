# Assessments

Here are all of your assessments for the course.

## Instructions

All homework assignments must adhere to the following submission requirements.

-   All coding assignments must be completed in a Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.
-   Work must be conducted entirely within Google Colab; offline work or use of other development environments is not permitted.
-   You must disable Gemini (Google AI) in Google Colab while working on assignments.
-   Generative AI tools may not be used to generate or solve any portion of the assignment.
-   Before the homework deadline, you must share your Jupyter Notebook with me (<amm503@pitt.edu>) through Google Colab.
-   Assignments that are not shared before the deadline will receive a zero for non-compliance.

Failure to adhere to these policies will have serious academic consequences.
If an assignment is found to contain work generated by AI, a zero will be assigned.
Repeated violations will result in a formal academic integrity violation report being filed with the university.
If you have any questions, please contact me as soon as possible.
