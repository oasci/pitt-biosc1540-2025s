In the ongoing battle against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, understanding the molecular interactions between drugs and their targets is crucial.
*Staphylococcus aureus* dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a well-established target for several antibiotics due to its essential role in bacterial folate synthesis.
This project focuses on computer-aided drug design of *S. aureus* DHFR
