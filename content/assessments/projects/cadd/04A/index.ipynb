    "1. Use this [link to the PDB file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasci/pitt-biosc1540-2025s/refs/heads/main/content/data/protein/dhfr/3frd-molmoda.pdb) to get a crystal structure of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a drug target enzyme.  \n",

Try rotating the structure to familiarize yourself with the overall shape. This structure includes water, cofactors, or ligands in addition to the protein itself.\n",

    "   - Co-crystallized ligands or ions  \n",
    "  \n",

    "4. Use MolModa’s protonation tool to add missing hydrogen atoms, which are often not visible in X-ray structures.  \n",
