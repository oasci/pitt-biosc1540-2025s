    "In computational biology, read mapping is a crucial step in sequence alignment, where short DNA sequences (reads) are matched against a reference genome.\n",
    "One way to accelerate this process is by constructing a $k$-mer index, which serves as a lookup table for identifying potential matching regions in the reference genome.\n",
    "Instead of scanning the entire reference sequence for each query, we can use this index to efficiently locate potential seed matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement a function, `build_kmer_index`, that constructs a hash table (Python dictionary) mapping each $k$-mer (subsequence of length $k$) to the list of positions where it appears in the reference genome.\n",
    "This index serves as the first step in seed-and-extend alignment algorithms, where we first locate potential matching regions before refining the alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This indexing approach is fundamental in sequence alignment algorithms such as BLAST and Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based mappers.\n",

    "2. Lists (`list`)\n",
    "   - Each dictionary key (a k-mer) maps to a list of positions, since a k-mer can occur multiple times in the reference sequence.\n",

    "   - Extracting a k-mer from the reference sequence using Python string slicing.\n",
