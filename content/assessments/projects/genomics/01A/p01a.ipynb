    "\n",
    "1. Open your coding environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor youâ€™re using).\n",
    "2. Ensure your code is complete, well-commented, and saved in a `.py` file format. For example, name your file something like `assignment4.py`.\n",
    "   - If you're working in Jupyter Notebook, you can export your file as a Python script by selecting **File > Download as > Python (.py)**.\n",
    "3. Double-check that the file contains all your completed functions and is ready for grading.\n",
    "4. Log in to Gradescope and navigate to the appropriate course and assignment.\n",
    "5. Click on the \"Submit\" button for the assignment.\n",
    "6. Upload your `.py` file by dragging it into the submission area or using the file picker.\n",
    "7. Wait for the confirmation that your file has been successfully uploaded. You may also see an automated output check or feedback after submission (if enabled).\n",
