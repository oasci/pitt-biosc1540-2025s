    "In this problem, you will develop a transition matrix for a first-order Markov chain based on DNA sequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Background and Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events where the probability of each event depends only on the state of the previous event.\n",
    "When applied to DNA sequences, a first-order Markov chain assumes that the likelihood of observing a particular nucleotide at any position depends solely on the nucleotide immediately before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X_n = x_n \\mid X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ..., X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}) = P(X_n = x_n \\mid X_{n-1} = x_{n-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_n$ represents the nucleotide at position $n$.\n",
    "This assumption simplifies modeling by ignoring dependencies beyond the most recent nucleotide.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing a transition matrix, we can quantitatively describe the patterns of nucleotide transitions in a given DNA sequence.\n",
    "This is useful in applications such as genome annotation, motif discovery, and evolutionary analysis.\n",

    "You will implement a function to compute a transition matrix from a given DNA sequence or set of sequences.\n",
    "The transition matrix captures the probabilities of moving from one nucleotide to another based on observed frequencies in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each consecutive pair of nucleotides (e.g., A → C, C → G), count how many times each transition occurs within the sequence.\n",
    "2. Convert raw counts into probabilities by dividing each transition count by the total occurrences of the preceding nucleotide.\n",
    "3. Ensure that your implementation handles very short sequences (length < 2), as well as cases where certain transitions are rare or entirely absent.\n"
