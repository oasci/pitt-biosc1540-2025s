    "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a key enzyme in synthesizing tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor required for synthesizing purines, thymidylate, and certain amino acids.\n",
    "By catalyzing the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, DHFR facilitates critical reactions necessary for cell growth and proliferation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, DHFR is a pivotal target for antibiotics, particularly against bacterial pathogens, and chemotherapeutic agents aimed at rapidly dividing cancer cells.\n",
    "DHFR inhibitors typically function through competitive inhibition, binding to the enzyme's active site and preventing substrate access.\n",
    "These inhibitors often structurally resemble the natural substrate, dihydrofolate, allowing effective competitive binding.\n",
    "Notable DHFR-targeting drugs include methotrexate, used in chemotherapy; trimethoprim, widely used as an antibiotic; and pyrimethamine, an antiprotozoal medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the enzyme's structure is conserved across species, variations exist that determine its specificity, affinity, and susceptibility to inhibitors.\n",
    "Understanding these structural differences helps researchers design targeted therapies against pathogenic organisms while minimizing effects on human enzymes.\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use PyMOL to retrieve, visualize, and analyze DHFR structures from three sources: humans (*Homo sapiens*), bacteria (*Staphylococcus aureus*), and protozoa (*Toxoplasma gondii*)."
